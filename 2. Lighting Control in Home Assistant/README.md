## Example #2: Lighting Control
#### Using Home Assistant & ESPHome

*The files used in the demonstration can be found in our [Github repository](https://github.com/ioios-io/demos).*

This time weâ€™re going to configure a ioios device to become smart light controller. **You do not need the same device to make this work, you can even make this on a breadboard if you want.** You just need an ESP chip, a rotary encoder and a screen. You will also need some smart bulbs, ideally ones which can acheive warm and cold white light.
